## Case Study 2: Palmoria Group HR Review Analysis 

### Project Overview
This Data Analysis project showcases a comprehensive HR analytics case study conducted for Palmoria Group, a Nigerian manufacturing company under public scrutiny for gender imbalance and compensation disparities within its workforce. Sparked by a damaging media headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy” the company’s leadership initiated a strategic push toward equity and transparency.
As the HR Analytics Lead, I conducted a detailed, data-driven investigation into critical HR issues across three regional locations, focusing on:
 - Gender distribution and workforce diversity
 - Salary structure and pay equity
 -  Employee performance metrics
 - Regulatory and compliance alignment.

The project aims to drive accountability, foster workplace inclusivity, and guide Palmoria Group toward sustainable HR practices.
